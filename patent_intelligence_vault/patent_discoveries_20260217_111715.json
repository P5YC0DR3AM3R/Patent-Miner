The inner tubing passes through the wall of the outer tubing near the upper end thereof and is connected to a pressurized cylinder of gas such as a standard 14 oz. propane gas cylinder. When the lower ends of the tubes are well submerged beneath the water level in a well, admission of gas to the inner tube at its upper end will force water up through an annular space between the tubes and out the upper end of the outer tube where it can be collected. A channeled plug at the bottom of the tubes prevents the tubes from collapsing, helps to keep them straight and together as they are lowered into the well and provides partial support for a weight hanging from the bottom of the tubes.",

    "abstract": "A method and apparatus for displaying the active oxygen content of a liquid metal and the sensor temperature of a probe from signals developed by the probe which is capable of being plunged directly into the liquid metal. The probe comprises a small mass of solid oxygen-permeable electrolyte in the end of a refractory insulating tube, an oxygen reference material in contact with the inner surface of the electrolyte, and suitable electrodes for providing both a signal representative of the active oxygen of the liquid metal and a signal representative of the sensor temperature. The apparatus comprises first recording means for displaying the sensor temperature, and second recording means for displaying the active oxygen of the metal, a source of power, and sequencing means which are initially responsive to the probe emf for sequencing the operation of the apparatus. The method and sequence of steps in connection with displaying the sensor temperature and the active oxygen on the instrument and the determination of the active oxygen on the liquid metal therefrom are also disclosed. The apparatus is portable, self-contained and operable from either a conventional a-c source or rechargeable batteries to provide a sequence of signals to the operator to advise that the probe is operative and properly connected, that the apparatus is ready to receive signals from the probe, that the signals are being received, and that the sequence is complete so that the probe may be removed from the liquid metal.",

    "abstract": "A switching power amplifier for use in low-frequency sonar applications. s amplifier comprises a set of four switching transistors arranged in a bridge configuration for switching a power source through a highly resonant, low-frequency, underwater transducer. The signal to be amplified is taken from a signal generator, filtered, converted to voltage logic levels, delayed and modified a predetermined amount in time to prevent a power short circuit through the bridge due to slow transistor switching, and applied to a set of four voltage transformers. A different voltage transformer is coupled to each of the switching transistors in the bridge circuit. These voltage transformers are coupled to switch their respective bridge transistors only when their primary currents are collapsing, thus effectively decoupling the bridge transistors and the power source from the signal conditioner and driver delay circuitry. An inductance is connected in electrical series with the underwater transducer to form a series resonant circuit with the transducer's shunt capacitance. This resonant circuit converts the squarewave output from the bridge to its sinewave fundamental so that it may be applied to drive the transducer. This resonant circuit also protects the transducer from short circuit currents and voltages.",

    "title": "Reliable earth terminal for satellite communications",
    "abstract": "A reliable earth terminal for satellite communications systems capable of unattended operation for extended periods of time is disclosed. The terminal includes an antenna with a single fixed reflector which can provide multiple beams, each of which can be positioned by small feed motion. The transmitter is of a modular construction, using a relatively low power traveling wave tube power amplifier for each increment in the operating band. The transmitting chains are designed to carry voice, data, or television signals to a satellite and include a modulator, IF amplifier, band-limiting filter, frequency converter, and power amplifier. Each amplifier is capable of operating over the full operating band; however, operation of each amplifier is limited to an assigned increment through the use of band-limiting filters. A single, redundant high power amplifier is provided and may be remotely switched into any one of the transmitting chains in the event of a failure. Amplifier outputs are connected to the antenna through a directional filter multiplexer. The receiver includes a low noise preamplifier featuring modular, \"fail-soft\" design. The receiving chains following the low noise preamplifier are channelized into band increments corresponding to those of the transmitting chains with separate converter and demodulator modules for each carrier. All subsystems are broadband, and channel bandwidth is determined only by intermediate frequency band pass filters. Prime power is low voltage battery banks constantly recharged by a commercial power source. The terminal can be operated for a limited period of time solely on the battery bands during commercial outages. A back-up motor generator provides recharging power during extended periods of commercial outages. The terminal is monitored and controlled from a central control point. Since the terminal is both automatic and self-protecting, remote control is limited to parameter adjustments required for normal operation, such as antenna feed positioning, changes in transmitter power, and switching to the spare power amplifier or turning off any carrier.",

    "abstract": "A urine collection container carried by a person confined to a wheelchair includes a drain tube which is connected to a valve mounted on the person's wheelchair to permit the person, unattended, to empty the contents of the collection container onto the ground or into a floor drain beneath the wheelchair. The valve may be manually operated, as by a lever within reach of the wheelchair occupant, or may be operated using a solenoid. The latter construction permits remote operation of the valve utilizing a low current sensitive switch operable, for example, by a quadraplegic. In addition, the solenoid operated valve permits the use of a timing circuit which automatically closes the valve a predetermined period of time after the valve is open to prohibit the valve from accidentally being left open and additionally to permit handicapped persons to both open and close the valve with a single switch operation.",

    "abstract": "Input data from an XY encoder stage is continuously monitored and compared to an internally generated count as the stage is adjusted in position. The internal count is generated a single count at a time by transitions in the X-Y input data on the basis that each transition is a one-step change in encoder position. A series of one-step transitions causes both the input data and the internal count to change together, or track. If a single transition is greater than a single encoder step, the input data advances ahead of the internal count and tracking is lost, causing a comparison error. The error halts the monitoring process, activates an alarm, and holds the current input data and internal count for visual comparison in a numerical display. The operator can then remonitor the faulty portion of the stage encoder to determine the nature of the error. The transition monitor is provided with internal testing circuit for counting up and down, changing counting directions, and detecting a prewired multistep test error.",

    "abstract": "Herein is disclosed a portable and collapsible mounting for numerous types of power saw units, which comprises a table-like device having an open frame top with adjustable hanger brackets for rigidly securing the base of a power saw unit thereto. Said frame top is supported by forward and rearward pairs of legs rigidly braced in use, but pivotally connected at their upper ends with the frame for swinging inwardly against the said top frame to compact the assembly of saw unit and mounting. In the compact or collapsed position the assembly may be readily rolled from place-to-place or pushed upon a transportation vehicle through the medium of special enlarged wheels which are mounted on bolsters depending from the rear portion of the table top construction. At each end of the table top frame of the mounting a pair of roller-supporting rails are slidably and adjustably mounted in the longitudinal sides of the top frame. The outer ends of said pairs of rails are rigidly interconnected by a transverse crosspiece which in turn adjustably carries upstanding roller support rods which in turn, at their upper ends, carry a shaft and self-aligning roller bearings upon which a central roller is mounted. The said roller may thus be adjusted by set screws working against said rods for various horizontal positioning for horizontal alignment with the upper or work surface of the power saw unit or for positioning above or below such surface. Upon such rollers, where the roller rails are extended beyond the sides of the frame, elongate and relatively wide workpieces such as wall paneling, plywood, elongate planks and the like may be accommodated and guided as indicated in dotted lines in FIG. 2 and as shown in full lines in FIG. 3.",

A temperature sensing thermistor located in the tip of a probe, adapted to be partially inserted in food being cooked so as to monitor the interior temperature, is combined in circuit with a programmable unijunction transistor (PUT), used as a bridge threshold detector, an NPN transistor-diode load current switch and a buzzer alarm coil such that upon the reaching of a preset temperature within the food, the buzzer alarm is actuated. The self-heat of the thermistor probe provides a latching effect ensuring the continued firing of the PUT with the resultant smooth operation of the buzzer alarm. A resistor is combined in circuit to allow a slight back current to flow through the buzzer coil, thereby allowing the use of a buzzer alarm with a fairly non-critical air gap.",

    "title": "Process and apparatus for suspension polymerization",
    "abstract": "In a suspension polymerization process which comprises polymerizing an ethylene halide by itself or a mixture of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium in the presence of a suspending agent and an oil-soluble catalyst under pressure, a pressure polymerization vessel the internal exposed surfaces of which are wholly or at least partially lined with wood is used so as to prevent adhesion of the resulting polymer to the exposed area. PAC BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a suspension polymerization process in which an ethylene halide or a mixture of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith is continuously suspension polymerized while adherence of the polymerization component to the wall of the polymerization apparatus is prevented and to a polymerization apparatus therefor. That is, as is well known, in the suspension polymerization of at least one monomer selected from ethylene halides including vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, or mixtures thereof or mixtures of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium in the presence of an oil-soluble catalyst and a suspending agent, the resulting polymer adheres to the inner wall of the polymerizatiton vessel and to the internal accessory devices such as agitating vanes, baffle plates, a temperature detector, and the like. This adhesion of the polymer reduces the yield of the polymer and a polymerization temperature adjusting ability and gives rise to problems such as difficulty in adjusting the polymerization temperature and mixing of the adhering material into the product thereby to cause deterioration of the physical properties of the product. Further, there is caused another problem from the standpoint of operation of a polymerization vessel in that removal of the adhering material requires an excessive amount of labor and time, reducing the rate of production. In addition, occurrence and growth of the adhering material is a great obstacle to continuation of the suspension polymerization operation. That is, in order to insure good quality of the product produced by a continuous suspension polymerization process, it is necessary to use a so-called multi-vessel type reactor so as to reduce reverse mixing as much as possible. For this purpose, a passage of a very small area must be formed at least between adjacent vessels, which in turn gives rise to the problem of plugging, whereby normal operation is hindered. It is known that the occurrence of the sticking material depends upon the material from which the polymerization vessel used is made and the content contained in the polymerization vessel. In general, with a polymerization vessel made of stainless steel severe sticking occurs. In the case of a polymerization vessel lined with glass, the degree of sticking is slightly reduced, but when this type of vessel is used, the polymerization vessel must be cleaned after every polymerization operation and, thus, operated by a batch operation. It is not suitable for a continuous operation. Although various attempts have been long made to prevent such sticking, a satisfactory method is still to be found, and this lack is a great obstacle to the continuous operation of the suspension polymerization described above. It is considered that the adhesion of a polymer to the inner wall of the polymerization vessel in the suspension polymerization process is caused by the monomer being first adsorbed on the inner wall and then being polymerized on the surface. In view of this consideration, as one measure for preventing adhesion in the suspension polymerization of the ethylene halide in an aqueous medium, coating of various materials capable of adsorbing water and forming a film of water on the inner wall of the polymerization vessel has been heretofore practiced. However, in all cases, the film of water formed on the surface is composed of a monomolecular layer or at most 20 layers, and this film may be easily removed depending on change in the conditions surrounding the film, whereby it is thus impossible to maintain the film for a long period of time. Therefore, it is possible to attain temporary adhesion prevention using the prior art, but it is almost impossible to expect a continuous effect. PAC SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned problems of the prior art and to provide a process for the continuous suspension polymerization of the ethylene halides mentioned above and an apparatus therefor. That is, in the suspension polymerization of at least one monomer selected from ethylene halides including vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, or mixtures thereof or mixtures of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium containing an oil-soluble catalyst and a suspending agent, polymerization under pressure is carried out in a pressure polymerization vessel in which the whole or at least adhesion susceptive surfaces of the inner wall and accessory instruments contained therein are lined with wood or are constructed of wood. As to the ability of wood to prevent adhesion in the process of the present invention, it is considered that because of its tendency to adsorb water, the wood forms a film of water on the surface thereof which acts as a barrier to a sticking polymer. The wood used in the process of the present invention adsorbs water within the interior thereof and forms a film of water. As compared with the prior method in which a film of water is formed on the inner wall of the polymerization vessel merely using a thin coating of a wettable material, the process of the present invention provides a film of water which is thicker and not easily removed, and, accordingly, adhesion is effectively prevented. Moreover, this effect lasts for a long time.",

An insulating material is then wrapped around these counterwound strips and a conductor helically wound around that. This design, by providing alternate flux paths down the core via the crossover points provides a lower, core reluctance and, when the core is under stress, provides a flux path that avoids the high-stress regions of the core thus reducing the amount of flux that is stress-modulated. Thus a substantial magnetostrictive noise reduction is obtained.",

The security of the data is also controlled by electronically sensing and comparing all operating and problem steps loaded into the CPU from library devices with a collection of identifiers known to identify all correct versions. The reaction to security dangers found in either sensing and comparing method is to exert predetermined counteraction to preclude unauthorized removal, alteration, destruction or inspection of problem data and/or procedures. The system includes a plurality of sensors which monitor operating control statements, operating and problem steps or procedures and physical switches on the CPU control panel. The remote secondary computer analyzes the sensor output and responds by a predetermined counteraction which includes initiating an alarm and descriptive printout at a remote location and indicating the source and severity of any security violation. Further, the secondary computer may interrupt the CPU and drain any illegal control statements and prevent the loading of the operating process and problem steps.",

The sensor according to the present invention relies upon the direct and generally linear change in the logarithm of the resistance of cobalt monoxide ceramic material as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment of the sensor element at elevated temperatures for partial pressures of oxygen which coincide with the partial pressures of oxygen in the exhaust gases of fuel-lean combustion mixtures. The present invention provides a generally cylindrical cobalt monoxide ceramic sensor element, supported within a housing formed of a compatible ceramic material such as alumina, and arranged so that the change in the electrical resistance between the ends of the cylinder of the sensing element may be measured. When the sensor is situated within the exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, the change in electrical resistance is a measure of the partial pressure of oxygen within the exhaust system and is also indicative of the air/fuel ratio of the combustion mixture which has produced the exhaust gases of the environment of the sensor. Such indication is usable to maintain the combustion mixture at a desired air/fuel ratio.",

A catalyst coated capillary tube within each secondary conduit has air drawn through it at a constant rate. On account of the catalytically induced combustion on its outer surface, the capillary tube exposed to the air-exhaust mixture heats more than the other by an amount dependent upon the concentration of combustible gas in the exhaust. The capillary tubes are connected in series; and the pressure at the junction, when compared with a reference, is a function of the combustible gas concentration. The use of two capillary tubes in each conduit connected in a \"bridge\" configuration eliminates the need for a separately generated reference pressure.",

A plunger is reciprocably mounted for cooperation with a lid release button. A slide is movably mounted in the base adjacent the leaf spring for movement between (a) a position interposed, and (b) a position not interposed, between the plunger one end and the leaf spring. The plunger responsive to operation of the release button moves the detent to the retracted condition, via the slide and the leaf spring, if the slide is in the interposed position. If the slide is not interposed, the release button is ineffective to actuate the detent. A linkage is provided between the cam and the signal pickup carriage of the player for moving the slide to the interposed position and not-interposed position when the carriage is, respectively, in a standby mode and a playback mode thereby preventing opening of the lid during playback.",

The operating voltage for the oscillator is developed across a capacitor, in parallel with a Zener diode, whose charging circuit includes a high-ohmic resistance connected in series therewith across a supply of pulsating direct current. The flow of charging current into the capacitor is controlled by a thyristor adapted to be fired by means of a trigger transistor upon a critical reduction in the amplitude of the oscillator output. The trigger transistor, upon conducting, lowers the cathode potential of the thyristor whose gate is connected, via a resistor and/or a diode, to the junction of the capacitor with its charging resistance; in one embodiment this gate is driven positive through an inverter upon the conduction of the trigger transistor. The thyristor may shunt only the charging resistance, or it may be connected in series with a second Zener diode across the voltage-generating network consisting of the first Zener diode, the capacitor and its charging resistance.",

A reference flow under constant pressure is established through an orifice dividing two plenum chambers, and directed through a flow sensing opening in a probe positioned in the flow to be sensed. The flow sensing opening is slightly larger than the orifice. A relative pressure indicator connected to the two plenum chambers indicates the velocity of the sensed fluid flow. The flow sensing opening is arranged so that the normal reference flow of fluid therethrough is in the same direction as the normally expected flow direction of the flow to be sensed.",

Improvements are in maneuverability, oscillation of the tennis barrel and immobility of the baseball barrel, remote control power for coaching options, replaceable and interchangeable barrels, variable timer speed control and a reliable hopper and feed system to enable firing of up to two hundred tennis balls unattended and without malfunction. Regarding the oscillation or lack of oscillation of the barrel, an actuator rod mounted on a rotatable disc causes such oscillation. When this rod is removed and the barrel clamped, this oscillation is eliminated. Concerning the variable timer control, such control is varied by two relatively movable rotatable notched discs. These dics contact a valve actuating mechanism and permit opening of a valve operated thereby only when the notches of the pair of discs are aligned and in contact with the valve actuating mechanism.",

In a preferred embodiment, the spherical or radiation directing elements are glass spheres having an index of refraction of approximately two at the wavelength of a light source being utilized. In a transmission type interferometer, both the spherical or radiation directing elements are utilized as beam splitters and collimators while, in the reflection type interferometer, one of these spheres is used as a beam splitter and collimator while the other is utilized as a retroreflector. The complete spherical symmetry of such radiation directing elements permits them to function with any orientation relative to the optical path between them. Mechanisms in which desired motions are controlled with high precision by applying mechanical feedback to position a movable body relative to a fixed reference body, using the above described interferometer arrangement are also disclosed. The same mechanisms are capable of being controlled from a programmed computer causing the movable body to exhibit a desired motion using interference fringe detection schemes to both monitor and accurately position the movable body relative to a reference body. Also disclosed is an actuator based on a hollow hydraulic cylinder having a given longitudinal axis which includes an interferometer arrangement incorporating at least a pair of spherical elements which have an optical axis substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of the actuator. Also disclosed are transducer arrangements disposed in series with the actuator which are utilized to meet high frequency stability requirements.",

Azimuth or position data from the navigator is repeated by a gyro in a remote head on the vehicle slaved by torque and signal cables to the navigator. If the gyro torque cables are opened, the remote head may be removed from the vehicle and mounted on some other body. The azimuth or position data of the body can then easily be determined from the position of the remote head relative to the navigator references. In particular, the invention is envisioned as usable in laying missiles or guns with the navigator and remote head being carried by a jeep or the like.",

A keyed AGC circuit in response to increased received signal strength decreases the gain of the RF and IF amplifying stages. When the received signal strength reaches a preselected level, as occurs during off-the-air signal reception, the AGC signal actuates a transistor switch which widens the passband of the filter in order to increase the ability to lock onto irregular sync signals.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a mooring method and system and includes a process of deploying and retrieving anchors, each anchor being attached by a long mooring line to a floating moored structure. For deploying an anchor at the end of a very long mooring line, a work boat reels out its service line. A remote release hook is attached to the end of the service line. A short pendant line preferably couples the hook to the anchor. A small buoy is desirably attached to the pendant line to maintain it erect. After deploying the mooring line and setting the anchor, the hook is remote released to thereby free the service line from the short pendant line. For retrieving an anchor, a submerged remote-operated catch hook is towed at the end of the service line in a direction intersecting the mooring line. The catch normally closes the hook. When the hook's movable catch engages the mooring line, the catch moves away from its normally-closed position, thereby allowing the hook to capture the mooring line. After the hook slides down sufficiently on the mooring line, a pull is exerted on the service line to unseat the anchor. The catch is then remote operated to thereby free the mooring line from the hook.",

    "abstract": "An improved \"bird-swing\" detector which has a downstream rejection system. An optical type bird-swing detector inspects glass containers as they move therethrough on a conveyor. A container exhibiting a bird-swing defect causes generation of a rejection signal. An oscillator may be set at a frequency in synchronism with the travel of the containers. A wave-shaping circuit forms the output of the oscillator into square waves at the frequency of the oscillator. A flip-flop has one input connected to the rejection signal and another input terminal connected to the wave-shaping circuit. The flip-flop output is connected to a multi-stage shift register. The signal from the wave-shaping circuit clocks the shift register. The switching of the flip-flop is delayed to allow entry of any information therefrom into the shift register before the flip-flop is reset. A reject or defective container signal is clocked through the shift register in synchronism with the travel of a defective container on the conveyor. In a rejection zone, downstream of the detector, a rejection mechanism is activated by a one-shot to reject the container. The final stage output of the shift register is gated with the signal from the wave-shaping circuit to turn on the one-shot at the proper time for rejection of a defective container.",

As the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas being sensed varies in response to variations in the inlet air/fuel mixture ratio, the resistance of the ceramic material varies. The active portion of the sensor body is a substantially uniform body of porous ceramic material having a density of less than about 85% of theoretical density and a modulus of rupture in excess of 11,000 psi. The sensor is fabricated from a very pure transition metal oxide powder having a very fine and highly uniform particle size.

In one embodiment, the electrodes and dielectric are arcuately shaped as concentric peripheral segments of different spheres having a common center and different radii. The front electrode and dielectric together have a thickness such that an impinging particle can penetrate them. The front electrode is negatively biased relative to the back electrode so that an impinging particle causes the front and back electrodes to become electrically connected to form a discharge spark between the electrodes. The discharge spark causes ejection from the front electrode of positive ions of elements in the impinging particle. An electric field is formed in front of the front electrode by a grid that is pervious to the particles and ions. The grid is negatively biased relative to the front electrode to draw the ejected positive ions away from the front electrode, so they impinge on a positive ion detector target. The arrival time of different ions is measured to complete the analysis. In a second embodiment, the capacitor has planar, parallel electrodes, in which case the ejected positive ions are deflected downstream of a planar grid by a pair of spaced, arcuate capacitor plates having a region between them through which the ejected ions travel.",

The wave structure is mechanically fixed to one mechanical member, and a probe is coupled to the wave structure and fixed for translation with the other mechanical member. A voltage controlled oscillator excites the wave structure developing a standing electrical wave therein -- the wave pattern node positioning being determined by the input digital command. Feedback servomechanism apparatus then responds to the potential induced in the probe (or, by superposition, that on the wave structure) for positioning the probe at the requisite standing wave null point.

The gated frequency difference detector consists of a dual output hybrid quadrature mixer, two parallel video signal processing channels, a digital phase/frequency detector, a digital scaler and a digital-to-analog converter. The difference in frequency between the RF input and the output of a local oscillator is measured. Two orthogonal frequency difference outputs are first generated, one of which either leads or lags the other depending on the sense of the difference. Signals are then bandwidth limited and amplified in two video channels and converted to logic levels. The phase and frequency are finally digitally detected and processed to generate a bipolar voltage proportional to the magnitude and sense of the frequency difference. The digital detection and processing apparatus includes in each channel a positive, zero, and negative threshold detector, the outputs of which are converted to a four-bit binary code.",

    "title": "Filter stabilized single oscillator transceivers",
    "abstract": "A transceiver, adapted for use as either a master or a slave in a duplex pair, has a single, voltage-tunable, solid-state oscillator to provide the carrier frequency wave, a small portion of which is mixed with the received wave and applied therewith to a single ended mixer; an automatic gain-controlled loop cancels transmitter input modulation from the receiver output. The desired oscillator carrier frequency of the master transceiver is locked to a frequency within the pass band of an RF filter at the receiver input and separated from the center frequency of the filter by one-half the receiver IF frequency. The slave transceiver is first locked to a frequency within the pass band of the filter on the opposite side of its center frequency and separated therefrom by one-half the IF frequency (the slave thus offset from the master by their common IF frequency). Thereafter, upon sensing output from its IF amplifier (from the master), the slave is switched to operate in response to AFC developed by the received signal, such that the master and slave transceivers are locked together at frequencies differing by their common IF frequency. The RF filter also limits the signals to which the receiver can respond. An integrating amplifier provides demodulator and AFC filtering and, together with a bistable device, initial sweeping of the oscillator control voltage in respective directions depending on being in the master mode or the slave mode. Internal auxiliary modulation provides for pre-transmission transmitter modulation cancellation and frequency stability.",

    "abstract": "A pair of pressure transducers are connected to pressure probes positioned in a flow passage of a turbofan engine downstream of the fan and respond to pressure fluctuations which occur in the airstream. One transducer has a high response capability, and its output is passed through a band-pass filter to isolate the high frequencies of interest. The other transducer has a low response capability, and its output is passed through a low-pass filter to provide the steady state pressure level. A triggering level is scheduled as a function of the steady state pressure level, and a comparator is used to continuously compare the triggering level with the level of the high frequency pressure signal produced in the band-pass filter. If the amplitude of the high frequency pressure is greater than that of the triggering level, the engine is approaching a surge or stall condition, and a warning signal is generated which may be used to institute corrective action.",

One of the pressure controllers is biased to provide a higher signal than the other; and such nonbiased controller is the one selected to control the valves. Each controller includes a pressure transducer, a summing device and amplifier, and a lead/lag circuit together with the appropriate power supply. A failure detection system is used to switch the controllers from automatic to manual when a predetermined combination of controller components becomes defective. Also, such system is so organized that a transducer failure for one controller causes the other controller to assume control regardless of whether such failure results in a higher or lower than proper signal.",

One end of the case is swaged over a flange on the fitting in order to sealingly clamp the diaphragm between a shoulder in the case and the fitting flange. The bridge portion of the strain gage is adhesively secured to the diaphragm. A pressure distribution member is placed over the bridge so pressure may be applied to the assembly during heat-curing of the adhesive which secures the gage to the diaphragm. The termination board has four terminals and a corresponding number of conductive strips. It is positioned in the case so that each of the conductive strips is pressed into electrical contact with a corresponding lead on the tabs of the gage. The other end of the case is swaged over the termination board to lock the latter in place.",

A mass of non-conductive reinforcing backing material having a thermal coefficient of expansion greater than that of the membrane strongly adheres to the conductive electrode and the membrane. The backing material is cured or solidified at a temperature sufficiently higher than that at which the electrode structure is to be used so that contraction of the backing material during curing places the membrane in a state of compression, thereby strengthening the same.

The gas-liquid mixture is thereafter directed to a unitized gas-liquid separator-conductivity cell where liquid phase is separated from gas phase and separated liquid phase utilized for conductivity measurement. The preferred embodiment of the unitized gas-liquid separator-conductivity cell includes an inner electrode tube extending upwardly into a larger diameter bore of a metallic outer electrode block, the portion between the block and upper portion of the tube forming a liquid phase reservoir with the liquid phase in the reservoir being utilized for conductivity measurement while between the two electrodes. Three alternate embodiments of a unitized separator-conductivity cell are disclosed as is a gas-liquid separator and separate conductivity cell. The overall system is small and compact, yet rugged, and is particularly well suited for selective detection of nitrogen, halogen and sulfur containing compounds, although not being limited thereto.",
