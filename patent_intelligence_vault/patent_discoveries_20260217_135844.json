    "title": "Oil well pumpoff control system utilizing integration timer",
    "abstract": "A valve in the production flow line of an oil well closes a reed switch indicative of fluid being pumped through the line. The switch closure activates a first oscillator whose count is compared with a variable frequency oscillator having a frequency of approximately one-half that of the first oscillator. The comparison is made over a given period of time to ascertain the percentage of time the valve has been open and passing fluid. Theoretically, the valve should be open approximately fifty percent of the time because almost that much time is taken on the downstroke of the pumping assembly when no production is occurring. The integrated timer is adjusted to shut down the system when the percentage of time the valve is open drops to the preselected amount, usually equal to or less than around 50 percent. In response to the integration timer producing a signal, a shutdown timer is turned on which restarts the cycle after a preselected amount of time. The length of shutdown time for the pumping unit is preset according to the well fill-in rate. When the system is restarted by the shutdown timer, a pump-up timer is turned on which is adjusted to allow for a desired pump-up time. As the pump-up timer is allowing the system to recycle, the integration timer is reset and the recycling is completed if the requirements of the integration timer are met. Otherwise, the unit is shut down again and the system recycled. A variable electronic scaler is connected to the output of the integration timer which monitors the output signals from this timer. A reset circuit between the integrator and the scaler resets the scaler to zero after a successful recycle of the system. A successful recycle occurs when fluid is pumped at a flow rate equal to or greater than the preset minimum when the pump has been restarted after a shutdown period. If the pumped fluid flow rate achieves the minimum preset flow value during or at the end of the pump-up period, a reset signal is conveyed to the scaler to reset it to zero and continue pump operation and system recycling indefinitely, or until malfunctions interfere with the pumping operation or production drops below a level economically feasible for pumping operations. When malfunctions do occur, such as parting of the sucker rod, the pumped fluid flow rate will remain below the desired preset value and no reset signal will be conveyed to the scaler. At the end of the pump-up cycle the pump will not be pumping fluids and will be shut down in response to the signal from the integrator assembly. Since there will be no reset signal to the scaler, it will begin to accumulate the shutdown signals. After the preset number of times the integration timer produces a shutdown signal, the scaler turns off the whole system. It can then be restarted manually. This provides a safety device for equipment failure such as breaking of the sucker rod. Means are also provided for recording the various timed cycles and also for monitoring the number of signals transmitted to the scaler, thus being indicative of the number of times the system has automatically shut down and successfully recycled. Also a circuit is provided to determine the exact percentage of time that the pump is producing fluid flow, whether above or below the preset minimum percentage. A continuous recorder may be used with this circuit to maintain a constant record of the percentage of time the pump is flowing well fluids to allow the operator to determine if the preset minimum percentage should be lowered, and how much it should be lowered to obtain successful recycling of the pumping system.",

The tubing has a small diameter length of inner tubing telescoped inside itself throughout most of its length. The inner tubing passes through the wall of the outer tubing near the upper end thereof and is connected to a pressurized cylinder of gas such as a standard 14 oz. propane gas cylinder. When the lower ends of the tubes are well submerged beneath the water level in a well, admission of gas to the inner tube at its upper end will force water up through an annular space between the tubes and out the upper end of the outer tube where it can be collected. A channeled plug at the bottom of the tubes prevents the tubes from collapsing, helps to keep them straight and together as they are lowered into the well and provides partial support for a weight hanging from the bottom of the tubes.",

The internal count is generated a single count at a time by transitions in the X-Y input data on the basis that each transition is a one-step change in encoder position. A series of one-step transitions causes both the input data and the internal count to change together, or track. If a single transition is greater than a single encoder step, the input data advances ahead of the internal count and tracking is lost, causing a comparison error. The error halts the monitoring process, activates an alarm, and holds the current input data and internal count for visual comparison in a numerical display. The operator can then remonitor the faulty portion of the stage encoder to determine the nature of the error. The transition monitor is provided with internal testing circuit for counting up and down, changing counting directions, and detecting a prewired multistep test error.",

    "title": "Combustion testing apparatus",
    "abstract": "An automatic combustion tester is disclosed. A burner is provided and is movable by a moving means between a first position adjacent a rigidly supported test piece and a second position. The burner is connected by a first conduit to a lateral tube which is, in turn, connected to a gas bomb by a coupling means. A flame timer is used for controlling the time during which a test piece is exposed to flames from the burner during a cycle. A down-time timer is provided for controlling the time during which the flame is removed from the test piece during a cycle. A heat shield is provided along with means for moving the heat shield between a position intermediate the test piece and the adjacent bunsen burner and a position removed therefrom. First and second microswitches are positioned to contact the conduit when the burner reaches its first and second positions. The first switch controls the heat shield and the second switch is coupled to a counter means for deactivating the system after a predetermined number of cycles of operation. PAC BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to testers for determining combustibility of materials. More particularly, this invention relates to devices using an injection needle, etc., to periodically blow a fine flame onto a test piece for a definite period of time, with a predetermined non-exposure period between flame exposure periods. The operation is repeated to determine the number of cycles required until the test piece begins to burn, to determine whether the test piece catches fire after being subjected to the flame for a predetermined number of cycles, or to inspect combustibility by dividing the time of residual combustion after a number, e.g., five of successive cycles of, e.g., three seconds of flame exposure and, e.g., three seconds down time by the volume lost during the operation. 2. Description of the Prior Art Various flame tests, particularly the last above-noted test, are conducted by hand. In this case, however, human error is unavoidable and results in very poor precision. For example, if the flame was successively applied five times for three seconds each time, i.e., a total of 15 seconds, the error accumulated through human inaccuracy may result in actual flame contact time of as little as 13 seconds or as long as 18 seconds. The flame exposure period commences after the flame of the burner is brought into contact with the test piece. However, certain materials are easily affected or melted by the flame before it is actually brought to the predetermined position and wide variations in test results are obtained when testing these materials. PAC SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the instant invention to provide a new and improved combustion testing system which minimizes error and is automated. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide an improved combustion testing system that will produce accurate results even when easily combustible material is being tested.",

    "title": "Network routing and control arrangement",
    "abstract": "A system is disclosed for selecting and establishing connections through a two-stage concentrator network utilizing path selection circuitry adapted to minimize blocking. This circuitry operates to select a path through the second-stage switch which is the least congested (i.e., has the most idle output lines). More specifically, \"congestion\" information is generated from \"outlet\" information specifying the idle/busy status of the outlets or terminals of the second-stage switches. This congestion information is logically combined with link information, specifying the idle/busy status of link paths interconnecting the stages, to ascertain if a path is available through one of the least congested second-stage switches. If a path is available, an idle outlet is selected on a least-congested second-stage switch, and then a connection is completed to the selected idle outlet. PAC FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to selecting and establishing paths through connecting networks and, more specifically, to arrangements for controlling the establishment of paths through two-stage concentrator networks. PAC BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART When a system ascertains that a connection must be established from a communication path through a network, it is desirable if the connection is completed over a path which tends to minimize the blocking potential for future connections. It is apparent that each time one connection is completed through the network, this increases the probability that future connections will be blocked. However, certain path selection and routing arrangements tend to minimize this blocking and thereby, tend to increase the capacity of a network. Conceptually, there are two distinct phases in the completion of a connection through a network. The first phase is known as a path hunt. In the path hunt phase, all accessible idle paths through the network are ascertained. In other words, all paths which could be utilized to complete a connection are ascertained. The second phase is known as routing and entails the selection of one of the available paths ascertained in the first phase. The connection is then established through the network over the one selected path. In prior art systems, several routing techniques have been utilized. One technique is known as \"random-selection\" routing and, in this technique, a selected path is chosen at random from all available usable paths. This technique is effective in that it tends to equalize the wear of equipment in the network. In another prior art routing technique, herein termed a \"most-busy\" technique, connections are completed through the most-congested switches or nodes which can handle the connection. For a discussion of this technique see, for example, page 1373 et seq. of the November, 1966, issue of Bell System Technical Journal. This technique is intuitively based upon the supposition that since the probability of completing a call through a highly congested switch is very low, if a path is now available through such a switch, the path should be utilized because for a succeeding call the probability of using this switch is also very low. Still another prior art routing technique is known as \"sequential hunt\" or \"packing\" and entails the selection of the first available usable route in a predetermined sequence of all possible routes. It is an object of this invention to optimally route and establish connections through a two-stage concentrator network in a manner to minimize blocking for future connections. PAC SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION I have discovered that connections can be optimally established to minimize blocking in a two-stage concentrator network by utilizing the paths through the least congested second-stage switches. The least-congested switches are defined to be those with the greatest number of idle outlets or terminals. More specifically, in accordance with this one illustrative embodiment of my invention, each stage of the two-stage network comprises a plurality of switches which are interconnected by links. A link map is generated which specifies the idle links associated with each of the first-stage switches. A second outlet map is generated which specifies the idle outputs for each of the second-stage switches. A \"congestion\" map is also generated which indicates the number of idle outlets for each second-stage switch. When a service request is detected over a communication line terminated in the network, information is obtained specifying the idle-busy status of the links connected to the first-stage switch on which this line is terminated. This obtained information is then logically compared with congestion information retrieved from the congestion map to ascertain the least congested second-stage switch over which the connection cannot be established. More specifically, a logical comparison is instituted to ascertain if the connection can be established over the second-stage switches with N idle outlets, in which N denotes the number of outlets on each second-stage switch. If not, a second logical comparison is instituted to ascertain if the connection can be established over the second-stage switches with N-1 idle outlets. If necessary, further successive comparisons are instituted until finally a comparison is instituted to ascertain if the connection can be established over the second-stage switches with one idle outlet. Upon ascertaining that a \"least congested\" second-stage switch can be utilized, an idle outlet on that switch is then selected. Based upon information identifying the first-stage switch, the derived information specifying the selected least-congested second-stage switch and the derived information specifying the selected outlet on the selected second-stage switch, the network is controlled to physically establish the connection through the network. In accordance with a feature of my invention, connections are established through the least-congested second-stage switches of a two-stage concentrator to minimize blocking. In accordance with another aspect of my invention a congestion map is derived from a map specifying the idle outlet status of the second-stage switches. In accordance with another aspect of my invention a sequence of logical comparisons are instituted to identify the class of second-stage switches with the most idle outlets having idle usable links connected thereto.",

Ring tool guide bearings and ring tool support bearings oppose and cooperate with the drive roller to retain the ring tool within the housing during its rotation. The driven shaft axis is canted at an angle extending beyond the center of the ring tool or toward the working side of the ring tool to counteract the torque forces produced by the working operation. Means are also provided to vary the drive roller pressure on the ring tool to balance the torque or, alternatively, to vary the drive shaft axis angle to balance the torque thereby producing dynamic stability during the working operation regardless of work piece resistance.",

The operating voltage for the oscillator is developed across a capacitor, in parallel with a Zener diode, whose charging circuit includes a high-ohmic resistance connected in series therewith across a supply of pulsating direct current. The flow of charging current into the capacitor is controlled by a thyristor adapted to be fired by means of a trigger transistor upon a critical reduction in the amplitude of the oscillator output. The trigger transistor, upon conducting, lowers the cathode potential of the thyristor whose gate is connected, via a resistor and/or a diode, to the junction of the capacitor with its charging resistance; in one embodiment this gate is driven positive through an inverter upon the conduction of the trigger transistor. The thyristor may shunt only the charging resistance, or it may be connected in series with a second Zener diode across the voltage-generating network consisting of the first Zener diode, the capacitor and its charging resistance.",

    "abstract": "An improved \"bird-swing\" detector which has a downstream rejection system. An optical type bird-swing detector inspects glass containers as they move therethrough on a conveyor. A container exhibiting a bird-swing defect causes generation of a rejection signal. An oscillator may be set at a frequency in synchronism with the travel of the containers. A wave-shaping circuit forms the output of the oscillator into square waves at the frequency of the oscillator. A flip-flop has one input connected to the rejection signal and another input terminal connected to the wave-shaping circuit. The flip-flop output is connected to a multi-stage shift register. The signal from the wave-shaping circuit clocks the shift register. The switching of the flip-flop is delayed to allow entry of any information therefrom into the shift register before the flip-flop is reset. A reject or defective container signal is clocked through the shift register in synchronism with the travel of a defective container on the conveyor. In a rejection zone, downstream of the detector, a rejection mechanism is activated by a one-shot to reject the container. The final stage output of the shift register is gated with the signal from the wave-shaping circuit to turn on the one-shot at the proper time for rejection of a defective container.",

    "abstract": "A flexible elongated strand-starting member curved lengthwise in a vertical plane has one end formed for temporarily plugging the bottom of a flow-through continuous casting mold. Extending from the opposite end of the starting member along one of its curved sides is a row of rack teeth. Spaced laterally from the mold and at about the same level is a storage housing that has a substantially vertical passage through it for the starting member, while a pair of reversible pinch rolls located about halfway between the mold and storage housing but at a lower level are in a position to grip the lower end portion of the starting member while its upper end is plugging the mold. The rolls withdraw the starting member and a metal strand attached to it from the mold and feed the starting member up into the storage housing passage where a vertical gear engages the rack teeth. An overrunning clutch operatively connected with the gear permits the gear to free wheel while the starting member is being pushed up through the housing by the pinch rolls until the lower end of the strand is past those rolls. The lower end of the strand then is bent down to separate it from the starting member and to straighten it while the starting member is supported by the gear, which is prevented by the clutch from turning in the reverse direction. After the strand has left the pinch rolls, the clutch is driven at a controlled speed in the direction that will allow the lower end of the stored starting member to return by gravity to those rolls so that it can be fed by them back to the mold.",

A catalyst coated capillary tube within each secondary conduit has air drawn through it at a constant rate. On account of the catalytically induced combustion on its outer surface, the capillary tube exposed to the air-exhaust mixture heats more than the other by an amount dependent upon the concentration of combustible gas in the exhaust. The capillary tubes are connected in series; and the pressure at the junction, when compared with a reference, is a function of the combustible gas concentration. The use of two capillary tubes in each conduit connected in a \"bridge\" configuration eliminates the need for a separately generated reference pressure.",

A plunger is reciprocably mounted for cooperation with a lid release button. A slide is movably mounted in the base adjacent the leaf spring for movement between (a) a position interposed, and (b) a position not interposed, between the plunger one end and the leaf spring. The plunger responsive to operation of the release button moves the detent to the retracted condition, via the slide and the leaf spring, if the slide is in the interposed position. If the slide is not interposed, the release button is ineffective to actuate the detent. A linkage is provided between the cam and the signal pickup carriage of the player for moving the slide to the interposed position and not-interposed position when the carriage is, respectively, in a standby mode and a playback mode thereby preventing opening of the lid during playback.",

Sensors are incorporated into the tiltable coupling to indicate the attitude of the down-hole drill, and some of them lie in a plane at right angles to the plane in which the axis of the piston lies; and hence those sensors can indicate the attitude of the plane in which the curved section of the hole will lie.",

An insulating material is then wrapped around these counterwound strips and a conductor helically wound around that. This design, by providing alternate flux paths down the core via the crossover points provides a lower, core reluctance and, when the core is under stress, provides a flux path that avoids the high-stress regions of the core thus reducing the amount of flux that is stress-modulated. Thus a substantial magnetostrictive noise reduction is obtained.",

In a preferred embodiment, the spherical or radiation directing elements are glass spheres having an index of refraction of approximately two at the wavelength of a light source being utilized. In a transmission type interferometer, both the spherical or radiation directing elements are utilized as beam splitters and collimators while, in the reflection type interferometer, one of these spheres is used as a beam splitter and collimator while the other is utilized as a retroreflector. The complete spherical symmetry of such radiation directing elements permits them to function with any orientation relative to the optical path between them. Mechanisms in which desired motions are controlled with high precision by applying mechanical feedback to position a movable body relative to a fixed reference body, using the above described interferometer arrangement are also disclosed. The same mechanisms are capable of being controlled from a programmed computer causing the movable body to exhibit a desired motion using interference fringe detection schemes to both monitor and accurately position the movable body relative to a reference body. Also disclosed is an actuator based on a hollow hydraulic cylinder having a given longitudinal axis which includes an interferometer arrangement incorporating at least a pair of spherical elements which have an optical axis substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of the actuator. Also disclosed are transducer arrangements disposed in series with the actuator which are utilized to meet high frequency stability requirements.",

The improvement includes the sensor device being disposed within a sensor housing which is, in turn, disposed within the hub cap and mounted thereon for relative rotation about a central axis of hub cap with the sensor device in alignment with the excitor ring. The sensor housing has a connector portion generally extending toward and aligned with the open-ended spindle and electrically coupled to the wiring when the hub cap is secured on the wheel. A friction and sealing member between the spindle and the sensor housing prevents relative rotation of the spindle and the sensor housing prevents lubricating fluid within the hub cap from entering the hollow axle through the open-ended spindle during operation of the assembly.",

    "abstract": "A shift network is provided which may operate on one full width operand or on two one-half width operands, by splitting the shift network in the middle. The shift network in the present embodiment for 96 bit full width operands is constructed in four ranks so that the first rank shifts operand bits 0, 1, 2 or 3 bit positions, the second rank shifts operand bits 0 or 4 bit positions, the third rank shifts operand bits 0, 32, 64 or 96 bit positions, and the fourth rank shifts operand bits 0, 8, 16 or 24 bit positions, all shifts dependent upon the input shift count. The shift network is responsive to two independent shift counts and a control signal specifying the half width mode when it is desired to split the network. Each rank of the shift network is divided into an upper half and a lower half. Special logic circuits are provided to extend the sign bit for the lower half operand into the lower half of each rank when operating in the two operand mode.",

    "abstract": "The present invention provides a sensor which is operative to sense the partial pressure of oxygen in the exhaust gases of combustion processes having air/fuel combustion mixture ratios in excess of the stoichiometric ratio. The sensor according to the present invention relies upon the direct and generally linear change in the logarithm of the resistance of cobalt monoxide ceramic material as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment of the sensor element at elevated temperatures for partial pressures of oxygen which coincide with the partial pressures of oxygen in the exhaust gases of fuel-lean combustion mixtures. The present invention provides a generally cylindrical cobalt monoxide ceramic sensor element, supported within a housing formed of a compatible ceramic material such as alumina, and arranged so that the change in the electrical resistance between the ends of the cylinder of the sensing element may be measured. When the sensor is situated within the exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, the change in electrical resistance is a measure of the partial pressure of oxygen within the exhaust system and is also indicative of the air/fuel ratio of the combustion mixture which has produced the exhaust gases of the environment of the sensor. Such indication is usable to maintain the combustion mixture at a desired air/fuel ratio.",

Improvements are in maneuverability, oscillation of the tennis barrel and immobility of the baseball barrel, remote control power for coaching options, replaceable and interchangeable barrels, variable timer speed control and a reliable hopper and feed system to enable firing of up to two hundred tennis balls unattended and without malfunction. Regarding the oscillation or lack of oscillation of the barrel, an actuator rod mounted on a rotatable disc causes such oscillation. When this rod is removed and the barrel clamped, this oscillation is eliminated. Concerning the variable timer control, such control is varied by two relatively movable rotatable notched discs. These dics contact a valve actuating mechanism and permit opening of a valve operated thereby only when the notches of the pair of discs are aligned and in contact with the valve actuating mechanism.",

Electrostatic drivers connect to the secondary windings of each step-up transformer and each forms a parallel resonant circuit which is tuned to an audio frequency within the operating range of the electrostatic driver. The impedance reflected into the primary winding of each step-up transformer is such that the attached electrostatic driver predominantly receives frequencies within its operating range. The necessity of a separate crossover network is thus eliminated.",

The device is operable to shut off air supply to the motor on failure of its governor to function properly in preventing overspeeding of the motor. The device includes a valve closing plate positioned in the path of air flow to the pneumatic motor, just upstream of an inlet port for passage of air into the motor. In normal operation of the tool the valve plate, which rotates with the motor drive shaft, is retained in a position spaced from the air inlet port by a locking mechanism engaging the drive shaft of the tool to prevent axial movement therealong. The plate locking device comprises a cantilever mounted spring wire in engagement with a groove in the drive shaft and a centrifugally responsive weight operably connected to disengage the wire from the groove in response to the attainment of a predetermined rotary speed. Upon failure of the main governor of the tool and consequent acceleration of the motor to such predetermined speed, the wire is disengaged from the shaft groove and the air pressure drop across the valve inlet port causes the closure plate to move toward and cover the inlet port, thereby stopping the flow of air to the motor.",

Steering control is provided by a connection with the towing tractor in laterally offset relation to the vertical pivot axis formed by the kingpin and fifth wheel articulate connection between the towing tractor and trailer. The steerable wheels in the trailer suspension are supported by a generally right angular spindle structure connected to walking beam assemblies for pivotal movement about generally vertical axes which are oriented forwardly of the horizontal axis of rotation of the steerable wheels with the spindle assemblies being interconnected by parallel, vertically spaced rods provided with universal connection with the spindle assemblies for maintaining proper orientation of the steerable wheels during their steering movement and during relative vertical movement. The trailer suspension includes independently and resiliently supported axle and spindle assemblies in the form of a two axle or three axle tandem assembly with the resilient independent support for the suspension axles effectively maintaining wheel contact with the ground surface for more effective braking and greater vehicle stability.",

The gated frequency difference detector consists of a dual output hybrid quadrature mixer, two parallel video signal processing channels, a digital phase/frequency detector, a digital scaler and a digital-to-analog converter. The difference in frequency between the RF input and the output of a local oscillator is measured. Two orthogonal frequency difference outputs are first generated, one of which either leads or lags the other depending on the sense of the difference. Signals are then bandwidth limited and amplified in two video channels and converted to logic levels. The phase and frequency are finally digitally detected and processed to generate a bipolar voltage proportional to the magnitude and sense of the frequency difference. The digital detection and processing apparatus includes in each channel a positive, zero, and negative threshold detector, the outputs of which are converted to a four-bit binary code.",

The malfunction circuit monitors the operation of the timer, pump-off control circuit, and drive motor of the well pump for detecting any abnormalities in operation and provides a signal if a malfunction occurs. The malfunction circuit is actuated by the pump-off circuit timer unless the pump-off circuit gains control of the driver motor and interlocks the malfunction output. A counter is provided to count a predetermined number of sequential failures before a malfunction is indicated. In addition, an excessive current measuring circuit detects malfunctions such as parted rods, split tubings, stuck valves and other abnormal situations.",

The sensor is comprised of a sintered ceramic body of transition metal oxide, such as titania, and includes a pair of spacedapart electrodes. As the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas being sensed varies in response to variations in the inlet air/fuel mixture ratio, the resistance of the ceramic material varies. The active portion of the sensor body is a substantially uniform body of porous ceramic material having a density of less than about 85% of theoretical density and a modulus of rupture in excess of 11,000 psi. The sensor is fabricated from a very pure transition metal oxide powder having a very fine and highly uniform particle size. The transitional metal oxide is selected so that the operating temperature of the resulting device is less than about 75% and preferably less than about 50% of the melting temperature of the metal oxide.",

A mass of non-conductive reinforcing backing material having a thermal coefficient of expansion greater than that of the membrane strongly adheres to the conductive electrode and the membrane. The backing material is cured or solidified at a temperature sufficiently higher than that at which the electrode structure is to be used so that contraction of the backing material during curing places the membrane in a state of compression, thereby strengthening the same. The resultant electrode structure is incorporated into a radio capsule which also comprises circuitry for transmitting a signal modulated in accordance with the concentration of the measured ionic species.",

Aerosols introduced into the region between the two electrodes interact with the flowing ions causing a resultant decrease in ion current. A decrease in ion current is sensed to indicate the presence of aerosols. A reflecting member reflects aerosols towards the electrodes causing a relatively lengthy interaction between the aerosols and the ion current.",

With appropriate potentials applied to the central wire and peripheral wall, ionizing radiation produces electrons which are attracted to the central wire and positive ions which are attracted to the peripheral wall in proportion to the intensity of the radiation. One or more auxiliary electrodes are provided which extend parallel to and between the central electrode and the peripheral wall. An appropriate potential is applied to this auxiliary electrode to neutralize the positive ions.",

    "abstract": "An electrolytic conductivity detector is disclosed that is particularly useful for gas chromatography. Small gas molecules that will support conductivity are conducted to a gas-liquid contactor where the gas is mixed with a solvent to form a heterogeneous gas-liquid mixture. The gas-liquid mixture is thereafter directed to a unitized gas-liquid separator-conductivity cell where liquid phase is separated from gas phase and separated liquid phase utilized for conductivity measurement. The preferred embodiment of the unitized gas-liquid separator-conductivity cell includes an inner electrode tube extending upwardly into a larger diameter bore of a metallic outer electrode block, the portion between the block and upper portion of the tube forming a liquid phase reservoir with the liquid phase in the reservoir being utilized for conductivity measurement while between the two electrodes. Three alternate embodiments of a unitized separator-conductivity cell are disclosed as is a gas-liquid separator and separate conductivity cell. The overall system is small and compact, yet rugged, and is particularly well suited for selective detection of nitrogen, halogen and sulfur containing compounds, although not being limited thereto.",
