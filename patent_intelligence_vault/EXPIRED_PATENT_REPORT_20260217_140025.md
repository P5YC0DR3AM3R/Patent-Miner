| Manufacturing Feasibility (Today) | 20% | 1-10 (1=specialized, 10=standard) |
| Modernization Potential | 15% | 1-10 (1=incompatible, 10=native fit) |
| Strategic/Market Fit | 20% | 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent) |
| Financial Attractiveness | 20% | Based on NPV trajectory |
| Legal/IP Risk (inverted) | 5% | Low/Medium/High → numeric |
| ESG/Sustainability Impact | 5% | Low/Medium/High → numeric |
