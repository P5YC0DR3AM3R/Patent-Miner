    "title": "Virtual intelligence shoe with a podiatric analysis system",
    "abstract": "The virtual intelligence shoe with a podiatric analysis system provided with a portable pair of shoe-like body types thereof, into two of which a miniature electronic module and an enclosed sensor mat are permanently embedded in the shoe-like with a mechanical air package enclosing the electronic module to serve as a shock absorption. A miniature electronic module comprises a transmitting circuit with pressure resistance, shoe temperature and warning buzzer for full memory capacity, which receives the variable pressure and temperature voltage signals, convert them into resistance (ohm) and Celsius, respectively. The electrical signals can be emitted in an infrared light signal. An enclosed sensor mat constitutes a thin, flexible, planar, resilient, and dielectric material that arrays seventy-four positions at strategic geometrical pattern to produce the precision of collecting data exerted by a foot or feet continuously and instantaneously in static and dynamic event during the full weight bearing in various activities. The conjunction of a pair of shoe-like body types, a digital foot scanner, a portable infrared light-receiving unit and a central integrator (servers) form a podiatric analysis system for enabling accurate information. An obtained information of each individual can be stored and analyzed for diagnostic means with respect to the foot or feet maladies. The virtual intelligence shoe with a podiatric analysis system is an unconventional, which can ultimately be used by anyone and capable to produce consistent foot or feet information to implement the changes in the foot or feet biomechanics by altering the shoes, orthoses or other modes. In a preferred form, a pair of shoe-like body types is virtually applied to any type of foot or feet maladies and worn daily as if they were conventional shoes under various terrain conditions.",

    "title": "Writing implement for identity verification system",
    "abstract": "The identity verification system employs biometric technology for identity verification. Positioned at the center of the system is a stylus with any of a number of biometric properties or their combination or with one or more metric sensors, while the customer uses the stylus to sign his/her name, or even for writing anything. The identity verification system is used at point-of-sale terminals, in various closed environments, to access a computer network, in applications involving pen-based computers and smart-pens, and for e-commerce. When fingerprint sensors are used, the sensors are positioned in the stylus grip, one sensor for the index finger, and a second sensor for the thumb. In one variation, one-to-one biometric matching is used. Each participant carries on his/her person a device that includes an encrypted biometric for reference purposes to gain access into the system. Processing is simplified since the system need only make a \"MATCH\" or \"NO MATCH\" decision. In a second variation that is particularly useful in closed environments, one-to-many biometric matching is used. During each event access request, the community of reference prints is searched for a match with the applicant. Each member of the community need carry nothing on his/her person to participate in the system. In either variation, the stylus is either attached to each site or is portable, one such stylus being carried by each participant.",

    "title": "Fiber optic interferometric vital sign monitor for use in magnetic resonance imaging, confined care facilities and in-hospital",
    "abstract": "A fiber optic monitor that utilizes optical phase interferometry to monitor a patient's vital signs such as respiration, cardiac activity, blood pressure and body's physical movement. The monitor, which is non-invasive, comprises an optical fiber interferometer that includes an optical fiber proximately situated to the patient so that time varying acousto-mechanical signals from the patient are coupled into the optical fiber. Responsive thereto, the interferometer generates a time-varying optical intensity resulting from the interference of optical signals, which are detected at a photo-detector. A signal processor coupled to the optical detector provides one or more processed output signals indicative of the vital functions. The monitor system has broad applicability, from routine monitoring of infants at home to detection of apnea, arrhythmia, blood pressure and trauma. The system can be implemented in embodiments ranging from a low cost in-home monitor for infants to a high end product for in hospital use. The monitor can be integrated with other sensors such as an EKG, a video or still camera, an oxygen sensor, a carbon dioxide sensor, temperature sensor or a microphone to get additional required information depending on the application. When integrated and combined with EKG information, the monitor provides ballisto-mechanical information of the heart for early diagnosis of cardiac conditions or prediction of events or for correcting corrupted EKG signals due to time varying magnetic and electric fields. In some embodiments of the monitor, the system can be made portable so that the patient can walk around while still being continuously monitored for vital signs. Another suitable design measures blood pressure continuously and non-invasively by containing the fiber optic sensor in a cuff that wraps around an arterial wall of the patient. The fiber optic monitor may be designed for use in a variety of settings including an operating room, a recovery room, an intensive care unit, a magnetic resonance imaging laboratory, a computerized tomography scan laboratory and an elderly care facility.",
